SYNOPSIS
       #!/usr/bin/perl

       use Net::Twitter;

       my $twit = Net::Twitter->new(username=>"myuser", password=>"mypass" );

       $result = $twit->update(status => "My current Status");

       $twit->credentials("otheruser", "otherpass");

       $result = $twit->update(status => "Status for otheruser");

DESCRIPTION
    http://www.twitter.com provides a web 2.0 type of ubiquitous presence.
    This module allows you to set your status, as well as review the
    statuses of your friends.

    You can view the latest status of Net::Twitter on it's own twitter
    timeline at http://twitter.com/net_twitter

    "new(...)"
        You must supply a hash containing the configuration for the
        connection.

        Valid configuration items are:

        "username"
            Username of your account at twitter.com. This is usually your
            email address. "user" is an alias for "username". REQUIRED.

        "password"
            Password of your account at twitter.com. "pass" is an alias for
            "password" REQUIRED.

        "useragent"
            OPTIONAL: Sets the User Agent header in the HTTP request. If
            omitted, this will default to
            "Net::Twitter/$Net::Twitter::Version (Perl)"

        "useragent_class"
            OPTIONAL: An LWP::UserAgent compatible class, e.g.,
            LWP::UserAgent::POE. If omitted, this will default to
            LWP::UserAgent.

        "source"
            OPTIONAL: Sets the source name, so messages will appear as "from
            <source>" instead of "from web". Defaults to displaying "Perl
            Net::Twitter". Note: see Twitter FAQ, your client source needs
            to be included at twitter manually.

            This value will be a code which is assigned to you by Twitter.
            For example, the default value is "twitterpm", which causes
            Twitter to display the "from Perl Net::Twitter" in your
            timeline.

            Twitter claims that specifying a nonexistant code will cause the
            system to default to "from web". If you don't have a code from
            twitter, don't set one.

        "clientname"
            OPTIONAL: Sets the X-Twitter-Client-Name: HTTP Header. If
            omitted, this defaults to "Perl Net::Twitter"

        "clientver"
            OPTIONAL: Sets the X-Twitter-Client-Version: HTTP Header. If
            omitted, this defaults to the current Net::Twitter version,
            $Net::Twitter::VERSION.

        "clienturl"
            OPTIONAL: Sets the X-Twitter-Client-URL: HTTP Header. If
            omitted, this defaults to "http://x4.net/Net-Twitter/meta.xml".
            By standard, this file should be in XML format, as at the
            default location.

        "apiurl"
            OPTIONAL. The URL of the API for twitter.com. This defaults to
            "http://twitter.com/" if not set.

        "apihost"
        "apirealm"
            OPTIONAL: If you do point to a different URL, you will also need
            to set "apihost" and "apirealm" so that the internal LWP can
            authenticate.

            "apihost" defaults to "www.twitter.com:80".

            "apirealm" defaults to "Twitter API".

        "identica"
            OPTIONAL: Passing a true value for identica to new() will preset
            values for "apiurl", "apirealm" and "apihost" which will point
            at the http://identi.ca twitter compatible API.

            All methods in Net::Twitter work as documented, except where
            listed in the identica/laconica documentation at:

            <http://laconi.ca/trac/wiki/TwitterCompatibleAPI>

            For simplicity, you can also use Net::Identica in your script
            instead of Net::Twitter, which will default to identica being
            set to true.

        "twittervision"
            OPTIONAL: If the "twittervision" argument is passed with a true
            value, the module will enable use of the
            <http://www.twittervision.com> API. If enabled, the "show_user"
            method will include relevant location data in its response
            hashref. Also, the "update_twittervision" method will allow
            setting of the current location.

        "skip_arg_validation"
            OPTIONAL: Beginning in 2.00, Net::Twitter will validate
            arguments passed to the various API methods, flagging required
            args that were not passed, and discarding args passed that do
            not exist in the API specification. Passing a boolean True for
            skip_arg_validation into new() will skip this validation process
            entirely and allow requests to proceed regardless of the args
            passed. This defaults to false.

        "die_on_validation"
            OPTIONAL: In the event that the arguments passed to a method do
            not pass the validation process listed above, the default action
            will be to warn the user, make the error readable through the
            get_error method listed below, and to return undef to the
            caller. Passing a boolean true value for die_on_validation to
            new() will change this behavior to simply executing a die() with
            the appropriate error message. This defaults to false.

    "credentials($username, $password, $apihost, $apiurl)"
        Change the credentials for logging into twitter. This is helpful
        when managing multiple accounts.

        "apirealm" and "apihost" are optional and will default to the
        existing settings if omitted.

    "http_code"
        Returns the HTTP response code of the most recent request.

    "http_message"
        Returns the HTTP response message of the most recent request.

    "get_error"
        If the last request returned an error, the hashref containing the
        error message can be retrieved with "get_error". This will provide
        some additional debugging information in addition to the http code
        and message above.

  STATUS METHODS
    "update(...)"
        Set your current status. This returns a hashref containing your most
        recent status. Returns undef if an error occurs.

        The method accepts a hashref containing one or two arguments.

        "status"
            REQUIRED. The text of your status update.

        "in_reply_to_status_id"
            OPTIONAL. The ID of an existing status that the status to be
            posted is in reply to. This implicitly sets the
            in_reply_to_user_id attribute of the resulting status to the
            user ID of the message being replied to. Invalid/missing status
            IDs will be ignored.

    "update_twittervision($location)"
        If the "twittervision" argument is passed to "new" when the object
        is created, this method will update your location setting at
        twittervision.com.

        If the "twittervision" arg is not set at object creation, this
        method will return an empty hashref, otherwise it will return a
        hashref containing the location data.

    "show_status($id)"
        Returns status of a single tweet. The status' author will be
        returned inline.

        The argument is the ID or email address of the twitter user to pull,

  SEARCH
    As of version 2.00, Net::Twitter implements the search functionality of
    Twitter.

    "search()"
        Performs a search on http://search.twitter.com for your query
        string.

        This returns a hashref which is slightly different than the other
        methods such as public_timeline. The hashref contains a key named
        "results" which contains an arrayref to an array of hashrefs, each
        hashref containing a single post. These hashrefs do not include the
        "user" item with the posting user's information such as the
        *_timeline methods do.

        This method takes a required hashref as an argument:

        "q"
        "query"
            REQUIRED: Specifies the string to search for. This can include
            any of the Twitter search operators listed at
            <http://search.twitter.com/operators>. Please see below for
            information about backwards compatibility with
            Net::Twitter::Search.

            Both q and query are aliases to the same argument. Specifying
            both will use the value specified for "query".

            Please note that you cannot use the "near" search operator to
            specify arbitrary Lat/Long locations. For this use the "geocode"
            argument below.

        "lang"
            OPTIONAL: Restricts results to a specific language, given by an
            ISO 639-1 code. For example {'lang' => 'en'}

        "rpp"
            OPTIONAL: Sets the number of posts to return per page, up to a
            max of 100.

        "page"
            OPTIONAL: Sets the page number (starting at 1) to return, up to
            a max of roughly 1500 results (based on rpp * page)

        "since_id"
            OPTIONAL: Restricts returned posts to those status ids greater
            than the given id.

        "geocode"
            OPTIONAL: Returns posts by users located within the radius of
            the given latitude/longitude, where the user's location is taken
            from their Twitter profile. The format of the parameter value is
            "latitide,longitude,radius", with radius units specified as
            either "mi" (miles) or "km" (kilometers).

        "show_user"
            OPTIONAL: When set to a true boolean value "show_user" will
            prepend "<username>:" to the beginning of the text of each post
            returned.

    BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY WITH Net::Twitter::Search
        In order to maintain backwards compatibility with
        Net::Twitter::Search, the query/q arguments can be specified as
        plain text:

            $res = $twit->search("Farkle McFancypants")

        In addition, you can, in this case, specify all of the above
        arguments in a hashref as the second argument to the search method.

            $res = $twit->search("Farkle McFancypants", {lang => "en"})

        Any query/q arguments in the hashref passed in this manner will be
        ignored, and the module will proceed using the string passed in the
        first argument as the query.

  HELP METHODS
    "test()"
        Returns the string "ok" in the requested format with a 200 OK HTTP
        status code.

    "downtime_schedule()"
        Returns the same text displayed on <http://twitter.com/home> when a
        maintenance window is scheduled.

DEPENDENCIES

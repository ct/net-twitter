	o Applied patch from Marc Mims to fix bad JSON from twitter in relationship_exists

1.20 - Mon Dec 15, 2008
	o Man I'm good. Missed a patch before bundling up the dist.
	o Fixes problem with relationship_exists from http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41667
	o Never release while on cold medication. Somehow I broke POD again for 1.19.
	
1.19 - Mon Dec 15, 2008
	o Fixed bad POD coverage.
	o Removed deprecated methods.
	o Why are even numbered releases always broken for me?
	
1.18 - Mon Dec 15, 2008
    o Brought up to date with twitter API specification.
	o Removed "since_id" from public_timeline
	o added "in_reply_to_status_id" to update
	o added "since" and "since_id" to replies
	o added "since" to friends
	o removed the "featured" method.
	o removed previously undocumented "lite" parameter from followers
	     and enabled "page".
	o added "follow" argument to create_friend
	o removed archive
	o update_location method is now deprecated, use update_profile.
	o added update_profile, update_profile_colors, update_profile_image and
	     update_profile_background_image methods
	o documentation cleanup

1.17 - Tue Aug 12, 2008
	o For some reason OSX is creating bad packages, which work fine on OSX
          and fail elsewhere. This one was packaged on Linux and should work.

1.16 - Tue Aug 12, 2008
	o For old times sake, I released 1.15 broken. Temp files from textmate 
	  made their way into the dist, which breaks make test. The best part is
	  it did so in a way that made all my tests pass. Good Times. 1.16 is
	  functionally equivalent to 1.15, just with the files removed.

1.15 - Mon Aug 11, 2008
	o Twitter is now requiring POST for some request and failing GET
          requests, for whatever reason. Changed requests to use post for
          those.
	o Update args to friends_timeline and user_timeline for July 7 API changes
	o Add rate_limit_status
	
1.14 - Wed Jun 11, 2008
        o Minor POD corrections. The documentation for user_timeline and
          friends_timeline did not correctly indicate that they're limited
	  to tweets for the past 24 hours.
        o Changed POD to address http://annocpan.org/~CTHOM/Net-Twitter-1.13/lib/Net/Twitter.pm#note_1922
        o This release is solely a cleanup, in anticipation of handing off
          maintenance of the module.

1.13 - Tue May 13, 2008
	o 1.12 had a POD error that caused make test to fail, which it
	  didn't do on my box because Ubuntu perl doesn't have
	  Test::Pod::Coverage. Mea Culpa.

1.12 - Mon May 12, 2008
	o Fixed internals so that the useragent is actually sent if
	  modified in new().
          -- Found by Ryo Okamoto
	o Brought current with API as of April 29. Added archive(),
	  update_location(), update_delivery_device(), create_block(),
 	  destroy_block(), test(), and downtime_schedule().
	o Fixed boneheaded documentation error in place since 1.06 where the
	  "friends"/"followers" terminology change listed which was
	  deprecated backwards.
	o Reorganized documentation so that similar methods are grouped
	  together, and each group is labeled.

1.11 - Wed Apr 23, 2008
        o Fixed Missing response_code and response_method on user_timeline
          -- Found by Roger Linder.
        o Fixed file perms on README and Twitter.pm re: bug 35344

1.10 - Wed Apr 16, 2008
        o Added "user" and "pass" aliases to new() for less verbose inline use.

1.09 - Sun Mar 16, 2008
	o Turns out I'm a moron and like to release stuff with debug code in it.
	  This release fixes http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34122
	
1.08 - Sun Feb 17, 2008
	o Never release late at night. There is a POD error in 1.07 that 
	  prevents make test from working. This fixes it.

1.07 - Sat Feb 16, 2008
	o Added support for the "source" arg to the update item, allowing a
	  script to have its tweets show up as "from SomeWidget" instead of
	  "from web"
	o Because of this, a Net::Twitter source code was requested from Twitter
	  and all tweets will now show up as "from Perl Net::Twitter".
	o Added http_code and http_message to allow the retrieval of the HTTP
	  response after each request.
	o Brought API up to date as of Feb 13.

1.06 - Mon Aug 6, 2007
	o Added support for retrieving and updating location information
	  from http://www.twittervision.com.
	o Deprecated all "friend/friends" language to match twitter.com
      terminology change as of July 19. new terminology is "follow/following".
	  See:
	  http://twitter.com/blog/2007/07/friends-followers-and-notifications.html
	o Fixed POD errors which were causing the automatic CPANtesters to
	  have fits.

1.05 - Thu Aug 2, 2007
	o After much delay, Net::Twitter now supports the full Twitter API,
	  including replies, direct_messages, and all the rest.

1.04 - Fri Mar 23, 2007
	o Changed module dependencies, now requires JSON::Any, instead of a
	  direct requirement of a JSON parsing module.

1.03 - 	Tue Mar 20, 2007
	o added $self->credentials() to allow changing user/pass to attach to
	  without having to create mulitple objects. This is especially 
	  helpful with POE Wheels.
	o Cleaned up documentation.
	o Added note about the twitter account for Net::Twitter itself
	  at http://twitter.com/net_twitter

1.02 - 	Thu Mar 08, 2007
	o Fixed Makefile.PL to remove leftover require of version
	o It's "perigrin", not "peregrin"
	o Added PREREQ for JSON. JSON::Syck is highly recommended though.
	o Changed version scheme from three segments to two, I never
	  wanted three digits to begin with, but Module::Build did it
	  without asking.

1.0.1 - Wed Mar 07, 2007
	o Removed dependancy on Module::Build and version
	o Added code from Chris Prather to fall back to pure
	  perl JSON if JSON::Syck is not found.
	o Fixed POD inconsistencies.
	o Added apiurl, apihost and apirealm config options to new

1.0.0 - Wed Mar 07, 2007
	o First Release
